# HVL EXPO Backend

Welcome to the backend server for HVL EXPO. The server is built with Node and uses MongoDB as a database. It also makes use of various technologies, such as Mongoose, Express, Passport, and Firebase for phone authentication.

## Usage

First, make sure you have installed Node and NPM.

To run the app with the database, a `.env` file must be present in the config folder. If it is not, the app will quit with an error message. To make one, duplicate the `sample.env` file inside config and rename it to `.env`. You must then fill it with the appropriate values, which for testing purposes can be a MongoDB instance running on the local machine.
